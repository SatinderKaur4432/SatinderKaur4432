- As a Analyst, I specialize in conducting in-depth research and analysis to identify, assess, and manage risks associated with global client engagements. My role involves translating complex data into actionable insights that support informed decision-making and help guide strategic direction.

On a daily basis, I collaborate closely with senior management and onshore stakeholders to communicate key findings, establish best practices, and ensure alignment with firm-wide and regulatory risk management policies. I use a keen eye for detail and strong analytical acumen to proactively identify potential risks, articulate mitigation strategies, and support compliance across all levels of engagement.

With hands-on expertise in Excel, Power BI, and SQL, I bring a data-driven mindset to every challengeâ€”leveraging big data tools to uncover insights, streamline processes, and support smarter, more strategic outcomes.
